Plugin framework for Kotlin

Based on ideas:

- https://www.gunsmoker.ru/2011/12/delphi.html (older,but some idea is actually)
- https://github.com/pf4j/pf4j (plugin framework for java)

Enhancement of pf4j:

- application must have core module(for spring - application starters)
- invoke method indirectly (from MethodDescriptor)
